# danylib
A sweet sweet code library that can be used for cool stuff like string operations &lt;3
It also has some functionality for more easily dealing with binary files and arrays of bytes that aren't text.

## Documentation
I'm going to set up doxygen documentation but I haven't yet, but when I do, you will probably be able to generate it yourself,
but you'll have to have doxygen.

## Installation
Two easy steps:
 - make
 - sudo make install
